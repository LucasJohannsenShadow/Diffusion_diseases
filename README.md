# Innovative Leaf Disease Mapping: Unsupervised Anomaly Detection for Precise Area Estimation

The task of detecting and quantitating diseased region in a leaf is an important task in plant breeding. In order to select plants based on resistance to diseases, the amount of infection needs to be quantified. Ratings done by eye and hand are not accurate, can be highly subjective and take a lot of work hours. Using machine learning, it is possible to generate faster more accurate data. By combining modern anomaly detection algorithms with masking algorithms a robust method capable of estimating the infected leaf area was developed . Using unsupervised models both for the masking and for the detection, the method can easily be used for different kinds of detection tasks.
